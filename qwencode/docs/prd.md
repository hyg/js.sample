# P2P DHT Node Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the product requirements for a P2P DHT Node system that enables direct peer-to-peer communication between nodes in different NAT environments, specifically designed for meeting applications where participants share a common invitation code.

### 1.2 Scope
This system provides a framework for nodes to:
- Automatically discover other nodes in the same meeting
- Establish direct WebRTC connections
- Use DHT for distributed peer discovery
- Leverage STUN for NAT address traversal

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Node Discovery
- Nodes must automatically discover other nodes in the same meeting
- Nodes must use a common invitation code to identify their meeting group
- Nodes must not have any pre-known information except for the invitation code
- Nodes must find other nodes through DHT network topology

### 2.2 Address Discovery
- Nodes must use STUN servers to discover their own public IP address and port
- Nodes must obtain public addresses of other meeting participants through DHT
- Nodes must not rely on centralized servers for peer discovery

### 2.3 Meeting Management
- All nodes in a meeting must share the same invitation code
- Nodes must be able to join a meeting using the invitation code
- Nodes must be isolated from other meetings based on their invitation codes
- Nodes must automatically leave when they disconnect

### 2.4 Connection Establishment
- Nodes must establish direct WebRTC connections to discovered peers
- Nodes must handle NAT traversal using STUN/ICE techniques
- Nodes must securely exchange connection information

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Architecture
- Implement a distributed hash table (DHT) for peer discovery
- Use STUN servers for NAT address discovery
- Use WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer communication
- Nodes must be stateless and scalable

### 3.2 DHT Implementation
- DHT must support topic-based discovery using meeting codes
- Nodes must announce themselves in the DHT with their public addresses
- Nodes must lookup other nodes in the same topic (meeting)
- DHT must handle node failures gracefully

### 3.3 Security
- All communication must be secure and encrypted
- Node identities should be cryptographically generated
- Meeting isolation must be maintained through proper topic separation

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- Node discovery should complete within 10 seconds
- Connection establishment should complete within 30 seconds
- System should support at least 100 concurrent meetings
- DHT should handle up to 10,000 nodes in a single meeting

### 4.2 Reliability
- System must handle network failures gracefully
- Nodes must reconnect automatically when connections drop
- DHT must maintain peer information even when nodes temporarily go offline

### 4.3 Scalability
- System should be horizontally scalable
- No single point of failure in the discovery mechanism
- DHT should distribute load across the network

## 5. User Stories

### 5.1 As a participant, I want to join a meeting using an invitation code so that I can participate in the conversation.

### 5.2 As a participant, I want nodes to automatically discover other participants in my meeting so that I don't need to manually enter addresses.

### 5.3 As a participant, I want nodes to obtain public addresses through DHT so that NAT traversal works correctly.

### 5.4 As a system, I want nodes to be isolated from other meetings so that privacy is maintained.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

### 6.1 Node Discovery Success
- When two nodes with the same invitation code start, they must discover each other
- Nodes must be able to find other nodes in the same meeting within 5 seconds
- Nodes must not discover nodes from different meetings

### 6.2 Address Discovery Success
- Nodes must successfully obtain their own public addresses via STUN
- Nodes must successfully receive public addresses of other meeting participants via DHT
- Public address information must be correctly formatted and usable

### 6.3 Connection Establishment Success
- Nodes must establish WebRTC connections after peer discovery
- Connections must survive NAT traversal
- Data transfer must work correctly between connected peers

## 7. Future Enhancements

### 7.1 Enhanced DHT Features
- Implement more robust DHT algorithms for improved scalability
- Add encryption for DHT communications
- Improve node failure recovery mechanisms

### 7.2 Enhanced Security
- Implement end-to-end encryption for meeting data
- Add authentication mechanisms for invitation codes
- Support for secure key exchange protocols

### 7.3 Improved User Experience
- Support for meeting metadata and participant lists
- Integration with existing meeting platforms
- Mobile application support
