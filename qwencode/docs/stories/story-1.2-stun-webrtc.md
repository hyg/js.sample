# Story 1.2: STUN Client and WebRTC Manager

## Story
As a P2P node,
I want to use STUN servers for address discovery and manage WebRTC connections,
so that I can establish direct peer-to-peer connections without relying on centralized servers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Node can connect to STUN servers for public address discovery
2. Node can establish WebRTC connections with other peers
3. Connection signaling is handled via STUN servers
4. Node can send and receive data through WebRTC connections
5. Error handling for STUN server and WebRTC connection failures

## Tasks/Subtasks
1. [x] Implement STUN client module for address discovery
2. [x] Implement WebRTC manager for connection handling
3. [x] Integrate STUN client with node initialization
4. [x] Integrate WebRTC manager with node initialization
5. [x] Add connection state management

## Dev Notes
This story builds upon the basic node initialization to add core P2P functionality:
- STUN client handles temporary address discovery
- WebRTC manager manages connections between peers
- Both components work together to establish direct peer-to-peer communication
- All communication after initial discovery happens directly between nodes

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests for STUN client functionality
- [x] Unit tests for WebRTC manager functionality
- [x] Integration tests for component interaction
- [x] Test connection establishment and data transfer

## File List
- src/lib/stun-client.js
- src/lib/webrtc-manager.js
- src/lib/peer-discovery.js
- src/index.js

## Completion Notes
All tasks completed successfully:
1. Created STUN client module for address discovery
2. Created WebRTC manager for connection handling
3. Integrated STUN client with node initialization
4. Integrated WebRTC manager with node initialization
5. Added connection state management

## Validation Results
- [x] All components load correctly
- [x] STUN client can connect to servers and retrieve addresses (basic functionality)
- [x] WebRTC manager can create and manage connections
- [x] Peer discovery module works correctly
- [x] Integration tests pass
- [x] Error handling works for all components
- [x] Module imports work properly
