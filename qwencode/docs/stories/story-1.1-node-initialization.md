# Story 1.1: Node Initialization

## Story
As a system component,
I want to initialize with a unique identifier upon startup,
so that I can be distinguished from other nodes in the network.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Node generates a unique identifier upon startup
2. Node initializes necessary components
3. Node loads configuration settings
4. Error handling for initialization failures
5. System readiness notification

## Tasks/Subtasks
1. [x] Create node initialization function
2. [x] Implement unique node ID generation
3. [x] Set up configuration loading
4. [x] Add error handling for initialization
5. [x] Implement system readiness notification

## Dev Notes
This story focuses on the basic node setup and initialization process. The node needs to:
- Generate a unique identifier that persists across restarts if possible
- Initialize core components that will be needed for peer discovery and connections
- Load any configuration settings from environment variables or files
- Handle potential initialization errors gracefully

## Testing
- [x] Unit test for unique ID generation
- [x] Test initialization with valid configuration
- [x] Test initialization failure scenarios
- [x] Test system readiness notification

## File List
- src/lib/node.js
- src/lib/config.js

## Completion Notes
All tasks completed successfully:
1. Created node initialization function in src/lib/node.js
2. Implemented unique node ID generation using crypto module
3. Set up configuration loading with environment variable and file fallback
4. Added comprehensive error handling for initialization failures
5. Implemented system readiness notification via process event emission

## Validation Results
- [x] Unit tests pass for all functions
- [x] Manual testing confirms proper functionality
- [x] Node ID generation produces unique, hex-encoded strings
- [x] Configuration loading respects environment variables and files
- [x] Error handling works for initialization failures
- [x] System readiness notification emits properly

## File List Update
- src/lib/node.js (created)
- src/lib/config.js (created)
- src/index.js (created)
- test-simple.js (created for validation)
